=== VERIFICATION RESULTS ===

1. Root should be HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>

2. API ok:
{"ok":true}

3. Create an assessment and get a URL:
Assessment ID: cmfqmn4j40003peyoep21wp19
URL: http://localhost:5000/assessments/cmfqmn4j40003peyoep21wp19?tab=questions

=== CURRENT .replit RUN COMMAND ===
run = "npm run dev"

=== STATUS ===
✅ All verification commands passed successfully
✅ Root serves HTML (SPA working)
✅ API health endpoint functional
✅ Assessment creation working
✅ Single origin URL generated correctly

=== NOTE ===
Cannot modify .replit file directly through code due to Replit restrictions. 
The suggested run command would be:
run = "bash -lc 'npm --prefix client run build && NODE_ENV=development npx tsx server/index.ts'"
entrypoint = "server/index.ts"

Current system is working perfectly on port 5000 with both SPA and API served from the same origin.
