Add minimal, production-safe export endpoints. No refactors.

Dependencies (server workspace only):
- pdfkit
- exceljs

ROUTER
- New file: server/routes/exports.ts
- Mount in server/index.ts as: app.use("/api/exports", exportsRouter)

Endpoints:
1) GET /api/exports/:assessmentId/pdf
   - Query DB:
     - assessment (id, createdAt, standard.code)
     - all questions for that standard (clause.ref/title, question fields)
     - all answers for that assessment (map by questionId)
   - Generate PDF with pdfkit:
     - Header: RUR2 logo (if available in /assets/brand) + “RUR2 – R2v3.1 Pre-Certification Self-Assessment”
     - Summary page: assessmentId, createdAt, standard, totals (questions, required)
     - Content: by clause (APP-A..G, CR1..CR10, UNSPEC if any)
       - For each question: “questionId — text”, “Answer: <value or blank>”, required/evidence flags, category_code (if present)
     - Basic page numbers/footer
   - Response headers:
     - Content-Type: application/pdf
     - Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="RUR2_Assessment_<assessmentId>.pdf"
     - Stream directly (no temp files)

2) GET /api/exports/:assessmentId/excel
   - Build workbook with exceljs:
     - Sheet “Summary”: assessment metadata and counts
     - Sheet “Answers”: columns
       [clauseRef, questionId, text, answer, required, evidenceRequired, appendix, category_code, category, category_name]
     - Sheet “Coverage”: rows for CR1..CR10, APP-A..G, UNSPECIFIED with counts
   - Response headers:
     - Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet
     - Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="RUR2_Assessment_<assessmentId>.xlsx"
     - Stream workbook.xlsx.write(res) and end.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change existing routes.
- Validate :assessmentId exists; return 404 JSON if not.
- Handle empty answers gracefully.
- Keep memory usage bounded (streaming, no giant buffers).
- Only new files: server/routes/exports.ts; only modified file: server/index.ts (mount).

Acceptance:
- Hitting both endpoints returns 200 with correct Content-Type and downloads with nonzero size.
- PDF starts with “%PDF-”, Excel opens in a viewer (xlsx).
Return: list of changed files.
